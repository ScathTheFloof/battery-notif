# battery-notif

this is a script written by ScathTheFloof that gives you notifications for when the battery is low \
the default percentage for when the notification triggers is 20% 

this is due to the fact that the reccomended percentage range that you should keep your battery at for maximum longevity is between 20% and 80%


# Dependencies

a notification daemon (mine is dunst :3)

# to install
clone this repo and run the installation script \
done! 

now your laptop will scream at you when your battery is low
